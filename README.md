# Fields of Mistria Save Editor

FoMSE is essentially just a wrapper that follows the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/NPC-Studio/vaultc) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FieldsOfMistriaGame/comments/1eyl4eo/basic_guide_on_how_to_use_vaultc_to_unpack_and/)

## Installation

Because of the reliance on vaultc, you will need to go to the [vaultc releases](https://github.com/NPC-Studio/vaultc/releases) page and grab the latest release. Otherwise, I've wrapped the Python files into an exe for ease of use.  

You can get the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/AlbusNoir/FoMSE/releases).

## Usage

FoMSE features a UI that is largely self explanatory, but it also has a help button if needed.  

## Planned Additions
- [ ] Add section (possible new ui) for common edits (e.g. gold, health, stamina, etc)
- [ ] Add icon
- [ ] More?
